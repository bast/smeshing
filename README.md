# Simple mesh generator in Python (fork of PyDistMesh)

This version of the code is based on
[PyDistMesh](https://github.com/bfroehle/pydistmesh) developed by [Bradley M.
Froehle](https://github.com/bfroehle).
This code generates unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes using signed
distance functions.
Like [DistMesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) and
[PyDistMesh](https://github.com/bfroehle/pydistmesh) upon which this work is
based, this code is distributed under the [GNU GPL](../master/LICENSE).


## Status and roadmap for this fork

Under heavy development. The plan is to be able to do large grids. We wish to
use the code to prepare grids for simulations on the Norwegian coast with
thousands of islands (polygons).

Prototyping work is currently done in Python. Later we will probably move to
Fortran or C(++) and introduce parallelization but provide a Python interface.

Currently the code is a bit hardcoded for islands and coastline and specific
resolution functions but later the code will be generalized and the hardcoded
aspects will be abstracted out.
