# Fork of PyDistMesh: A Simple Mesh Generator in Python

This version of the code is based on
[PyDistMesh](https://github.com/bfroehle/pydistmesh) developed by [Bradley M.
Froehle](https://github.com/bfroehle).
This code generates unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes using signed
distance functions.
Like [DistMesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) and
[PyDistMesh](https://github.com/bfroehle/pydistmesh) upon which this work is
based, this code is distributed under the [GNU GPL](../master/LICENSE).


## Building the C lib used by the Python code

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


## Installing the code and its dependencies

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running tests

```
py.test -vv distmesh/test.py
```


## Plotting

Example:
```
python distmesh/plot.py test/circle.txt circle.png
```
